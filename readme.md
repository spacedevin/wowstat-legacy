WoW Stat
--

WoW Stat is a World of Warcraft server monitor utility. It is very simple and easy to use. You set the server you wish to monitor, and it does the rest! If your server goes down it will automatically notify you when it is back up, and even relaunch WoW for you if you want. 

### Updates!
I am currently porting this over to Javascript for use with Titanium.

### Status
I havent really used a windows pc in a few years, played wow, or used C# for anything, so this code is as-is. It may or may not work, but feel free to do whatever you want with it. Created in 2007 so it's a bit old.
